# My 1337 Pool Experience

This repository contains my work on the 1337 Pool, an intensive coding bootcamp at the 1337 School (42 Network).

## About the 1337 Pool

The 1337 Pool is a month-long coding bootcamp in Morocco where participants learn C programming from scratch. It's known for its peer-to-peer learning model and project-based curriculum.

## Skills Learned

- Proficiency in C programming
- Understanding of low-level concepts
- Problem-solving and debugging skills
- Peer-to-peer learning and collaboration

## Experience

The 1337 Pool was a challenging but rewarding experience. I learned a lot about C programming and problem-solving. The peer-to-peer learning model was particularly effective, as it allowed me to learn from my peers and also solidify my understanding by explaining concepts to others.
